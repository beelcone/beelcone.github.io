O Captain, My Captain, I’m happy that you admit to it. You haven’t asked me yet but I’m gonna let you know that you have a way with me too. I don't know why I never played Yoko Ono to you before but I’m glad you find it cool. Simple and honest it is and will be, my captain. Sometimes I just sit there and think, you and me, WHAT IS THIS PLOT TWIST? I have used a lot of my songs to say things that I can’t say otherwise and I wanna be your girlfriend is one of them, I mean I’m honest but not very bold and even that changed yesterday night so let us see what all you can make me do, my captain. I listen to songs a lot more carefully now, guessing which line would you like the most. I love this leaving each other a message thing so much, thank you for leaving the very first one. I like the idea of this data flying in space and aliens not having the technology to read it. Also, you don’t need to worry your pretty little mind about how you say things. Just say what’s on your mind and that’ll be enough to make my knees go weak, my captain. Great progress with the boldness, I physically ached.
